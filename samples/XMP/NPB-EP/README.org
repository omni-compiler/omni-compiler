==========================================
These are serial versions of the NPB2.3
suite.  All previous evidence of parallelism 
has been removed from the codes.  These 
versions are intended to be starting points
for the development of both shared memory 
and distributed memory versions, for the 
testing parallelization tools, and also
as single processor benchmarks.  New to
the NPB2.3 and NPB2.3-serial suites is the inclusion
of a Class W size, which all run in about
20 Mb of memory, and are intended to be 
used on workstations or PC's.

NOTE: Please see the very important 
      "IS/README.carefully" in the IS
      directory before using this code.
NOTE: Please see the very important 
      "CG/README.carefully" in the CG
      directory before using this code.

NPB 2.X PLANS

The NAS Parallel Benchmark 2 Team plans a staged release of modified
and new benchmarks in the coming months. These new releases correct
deficiencies in the preliminary release, 2.0. We do not intend to make
more releases beyond those mentioned here unless there is a
substantial problem.

Summary of (planned) releases:

     2.1 New LU and BT.
     2.2 - IS in C.
         - EP.
         - New FT with a 2-D decomposition, plus additional optimizations.
     2.3 CG Benchmark.

Status of NPB 2.3 codes:
 - We consider SP, BT, LU, MG EP, FT, and IS completely stable
 - CG is now in "Beta" release.

The accompanying report specifies the CLASS C test cases for both 
NPB 1.0 and NPB 2.x, including verification numbers.

=============================

Changes in 2.3

- Added CG

=============================

Changes in 2.2

- Added IS in C
- Modified FT so that it can be run on a number of processors
  larger than the last array dimension
- Added EP 
- Encoded CLASS C size and verification numbers
- Removed include file mpifrag.f containing executable statements
- Added different versions of random number generators

=============================

Changes in 2.1

- Modified SP to report more accurate flop count
- Modified BT to report correct flop count (bt.f)
- Modified BT (x_solve.f) 5x5 block tridiagonal routine are unrolled
- Modified LU routines blts.f and buts.f to do column based relaxation
  (rather than diagonal based), and routine exchange_1.f to communicate at 
  edges of processor (rather than at ends of each subsequent diagonal).
  Result is significantly less communication.  
- Modified LU routines blts.f and buts.f by unrolling the loops of the 
  5x5 block tridiagonal sections.
- Added comments in config/NAS examples
- Removed an unnecessary echo from sys/make.common
- Added mail and email address for benchmark output in print_results.f
